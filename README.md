!Series_summary	"Chronic exposure to sunlight is linked to premature aging (photoaging) and UV radiations is implicated to be the main contributor of this phenomenon. It causes changes to dermal collgen through two major pathways; promotion of collagen breakdown and lost of collagen content via the inhibition of collagen biosynthesis. The absorption of UV radiations by skin molecules generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which lead to oxidative damage of cellular components such as cell walls, lipid membranes, mitochondria and DNA. Therefore, this research involve the identification of key genes in biological processes through high throughput RNA Sequencing technology to identify genes and pathways underlying skin aging health and diseases due to UV exposure, ultimately leading to novel ways of managing, diagnose, treat and prevent/slow down skin aging illnesses/wrinkles.The results from this study produces huge amount of  differential expressed genes (DEG) as a result of UV exposure which were subsquently validated with qPCR."

At 80 - 90% confluence, prior to UV exposure, the cells were washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 thrice and subsequently replaced the culture medium with 5 mL PBS and the cells were UV irradiated with 20 mJ/cm2. After this, the PBS was discarded and replaced with growth medium and incubated for another 24hrs at 37oC in 5% CO2. Same protocol was carried out for the control sample but it was not exposed to UV radiations."
